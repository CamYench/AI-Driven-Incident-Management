# Product Requirements Document: AI-Assisted Incident Response System

**Version**: 13  
**Date**: June 9, 2025  
**Author**: Cameron Yenche

## 1. Objective

The AI-Assisted Incident Response System automates customer-facing incident communications for Abnormal Security, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to:

- Reduce manual effort and response time during incidents.
- Ensure consistent, on-brand, and compliant messaging.
- Improve clarity around customer impact, while minimizing internal noise.
- Integrate into existing incident response workflows.

This addresses delays, inconsistencies, and errors in processes, reinforcing customer trust through high-quality, timely updates.
## 2. User Stories

The following user stories capture the needs of key stakeholders:

### P0: Must Have
These requirements are essential for the system to meet it's primary objectives and support all personas.
- **3.1 Incident Data Ingestion (P0)** 
    - Ingest structured (e.g., JSON with incident ID, severity, affected services) and unstructured (e.g., engineer notes) data from incident management tools like PagerDuty or Jira via APIs or webhooks.
    - Ensure compatibility with existing tools to capture all relevant incident details.
    - *Derived From:* 
	    - All user stories (foundational for incident processing, triage, and communication).
    
- **3.2 Message Generation (P0)**

	- Validate messages for accuracy and compliance, omitting internal details (e.g., system logs).
	- Follow industry best practices from Atlassia and PagerDuty Incident Communications.
	-  _Derived from_:
	    - Customer Support: "I want the system to automatically draft, vet, and send incident communication messages for non-severe and straightforward customer communications."
	    - Customer: "I want to receive timely, clear, and accurate updates about incidents affecting me."
